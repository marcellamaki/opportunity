        <div class="accelerate-title">
          Census Open Innovation Labs (COIL) is a nimble, startup-like team within the U.S. Census Bureau with a portfolio of projects that are setting a standard for open innovation across government.
        </div>
        <div class="accelerate-text usa-width-three-fourths">
          <p>COIL leverages the networks, talents, and expertise of companies, organizations, and individuals
            outside our own walls to deliver on two key objectives:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>increasing American prosperity by disseminating federal open data, and</li>
            <li>increasing response rates for the 2020 Census, particularly among communities
              considered <strong>"hard to count"</strong> - those historically yielding low response rates.</li>
          </ul>
          <br>
          <p>COIL's open innovation strategies include ideation workshops, user-centered design, user experience
          research, technology development sprints, prize competitions, crowdsourcing, and creative partnerships.
          These initiatives solve major national problems by engaging a diverse ecosystem of stakeholders from
          the tech, media, and entertainment industries; federal, state and local government; nonprofit organizations,
          advocates, local communities, and more.</p></div>

              by COIL, to drive new digital solutions that leverage federal, state and local open data to directly
              serve families, local leaders, and businesses and communities at large. To date, 80 products have been
              created through TOP, addressing problems like the opioid crisis, disaster response, veterans'
